The condition of ongoing pandemic of Covid-19 is horrible in India. With the ongoing crisis, India is not lagging behind because of the lack of resources but it is the lack of information of resources that has resulted in hazardous outcomes. People are dying here just because they didn’t have proper information how to get required covid resources (eg. oxygen, medicines, beds etc) at the instance of panic situation that has caused a lot of hiatus in providing health services to the needy. There is lack of these resources at some locations whereas at some cities these can be found in abundance. 

We are the group of student working across communities to help connect relevant members based on broad objectives or specific needs.
We have created a database of verified resources and our volunteers managed it efficiently by continuously updating the data. This will help to save precious time for other people and panic situations can be avoided in this unpleasant time. This will also help us to reduce spam and frauds going across in the hour of the need which are being used by the antisocial elements to fulfill their greed.

We are using Twilio Programmable message  service for WhatsApp API for our initiative to work. WhatsApp is the most popular application among people in India to connect and share information with each other.
